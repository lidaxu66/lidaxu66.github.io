**Broadband topological, nonlinear, and integrated photonics:** I build photonic integrated circuits that harness topological properties
across octave-spanning bandwidths to create turnkey, robust nonlinear devices with wafer-scale reproducibility. My work spans topological frequency combs, on-chip multi-timescale synchronization, broadband artificial gauge fields, and integrated harmonic generation —
simultaneously advancing practical device engineering and probing fundamental topological physics and quantum optics.

I consider myself a hybrid of a physicist and an engineer, and a hybrid of an experimentalist and a theorist. 
Fundamental science is cool, and I try to benefit the real world with it.
