abstract: On-chip generation of optical frequency combs using nonlinear ring resonators has enabled numerous applications of combs that were otherwise limited to mode-locked lasers. Nevertheless, on-chip frequency combs have relied predominantly on single-ring resonators. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of a novel class of frequency combs, the topological frequency combs, in a two-dimensional lattice of hundreds of ring resonators that hosts fabrication-robust topological edge states with linear dispersion. By pumping these edge states, we demonstrate the generation of a nested frequency comb that shows oscillation of multiple edge state resonances across ≈40 longitudinal modes and is spatially confined at the lattice edge. Our results provide an opportunity to explore the interplay between topological physics and nonlinear frequency comb generation in a commercially available nanophotonic platform.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Topological frequency combs are novel types of Kerr frequency combs. When pumping the topological photonic lattice spectrally in the edge band, nested frequency combs are generated, inheriting the topological properties of the lattice.
