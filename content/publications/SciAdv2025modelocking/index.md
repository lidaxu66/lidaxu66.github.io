abstract: On-chip generation of optical frequency combs using nonlinear ring resonators has enabled numerous applications of combs that were otherwise limited to mode-locked lasers. Nevertheless, on-chip frequency combs have relied predominantly on single-ring resonators. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of a novel class of frequency combs, the topological frequency combs, in a two-dimensional lattice of hundreds of ring resonators that hosts fabrication-robust topological edge states with linear dispersion. By pumping these edge states, we demonstrate the generation of a nested frequency comb that shows oscillation of multiple edge state resonances across ≈40 longitudinal modes and is spatially confined at the lattice edge. Our results provide an opportunity to explore the interplay between topological physics and nonlinear frequency comb generation in a commercially available nanophotonic platform.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Simultaneous mode locking of Kerr frequency combs on 1THz and 4GHz are observed with the multi-timescale topological frequency combs.
